# AI-CAR-PEDESTRIAN-TRACKING
Car &amp; Pedestrian tracking system in python programming language using OpenCV haar-cascade algorithm.

### STEPS TO FOLLOW TO CREATE A FACE DETECTION MODEL

##### STEP 1 : Load some pre-trained data on cars (haar cascade algorithm). 
##### STEP 2 : Convert to gray scale - It improves the processing power as the algorithm now only has to work with brightness and not the RGB format (3x less data)
##### STEP 3 : Detect Cars - The pre-trained haarcascades algorithm determines the coordinates around the cars.
##### STEP 4 : Draw Rectange around Cars.
##### STEP 5 : Create a loop so it can determine more than one face.
##### STEP 6 : Now we have to repete the same process for pedestrian. 
 
 
 
 
### LIBRARY AND ALGORITHM USED

* **OpenCV** : It is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

* **Haar Cascade classifier** : It is based on the Haar Wavelet technique to analyze pixels in the image into squares by function. ... Haar cascade classifier is based on the Viola-Jones detection algorithm which is trained in given some input faces and non-faces and training a classifier that identifies a face.
